# 6. Tools and Frameworks

Think of these as the "software toolkits" that make building deep learning models much easier. Here are the main ones:

## [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (Most Popular for Learning)

**What it is**: Facebook's deep learning toolkit that feels like regular Python code.

**Why beginners love it**:

- Easier to understand and debug
- Feels like writing normal Python
- Great for experimenting and learning
- Lots of tutorials online

**Best for**: Students, researchers, and people learning deep learning

## [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) (Most Popular for Business)

**What it is**: Google's deep learning toolkit designed for big, real-world applications.

**Why companies use it**:

- Built for deploying models to millions of users
- Works on phones, websites, and servers
- Very stable and well-supported
- Great for production systems

**Best for**: Companies building real products and services

## [Keras](https://keras.io/) (Easiest to Start With)

**What it is**: A simple layer on top of TensorFlow that makes deep learning even easier.

**Why it's beginner-friendly**:

- Requires very little code
- Clear, simple commands
- Great documentation
- Perfect for first projects

**Best for**: Complete beginners who want to get started quickly

## Which Should You Choose?

**Complete Beginner**: Start with **Keras**

- Easiest to learn
- Fewest lines of code needed
- Great tutorials

**Learning Deep Learning**: Move to **PyTorch**

- Industry standard for learning
- Easier to understand what's happening
- Great community support

**Building Real Products**: Consider **TensorFlow**

- Best for deploying to users
- Most stable for production
- Widely used in industry

**Bottom Line**: Start with Keras, then learn PyTorch. You can always learn others later!
