# 5. Deep Learning Architecture Types

Different types of neural networks are specialized for different kinds of data. Here are the main types you should know about:

## 1. Feedforward Neural Networks (The Basic Type)

**What it does**: Information flows in one direction—from input to output.

**Best for**:

- Simple prediction tasks
- Spreadsheet-like data (numbers in columns)
- Getting started with deep learning

**Think of it like**: A basic assembly line—data goes in one end, gets processed, and results come out the other end.

## 2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) - For Images

**What it does**: Specifically designed to understand images by looking at small parts first, then combining them.

**Best for**:

- Photo recognition (cats, dogs, objects)
- Medical image analysis (X-rays, MRIs)
- Self-driving cars (recognizing road signs)

**Think of it like**: How you recognize a face—first you see eyes, nose, mouth, then put them together to recognize the person.

**Real examples**: Google Photos organizing your pictures, Instagram filters

## 3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) - For Sequences

**What it does**: Has memory—can remember previous information when processing new data.

**Best for**:

- Text and language (translations, chatbots)
- Time series (stock prices, weather forecasting)
- Speech recognition (Siri understanding you)

**Think of it like**: Reading a book—you need to remember previous sentences to understand the current one.

**Real examples**: Google Translate, autocomplete on your phone

## 4. Transformers - The New Powerhouse

**What it does**: Can pay attention to different parts of the input simultaneously (like reading a whole paragraph at once instead of word by word).

**Best for**:

- Advanced language tasks
- Chatbots and AI assistants
- Text summarization

**Think of it like**: A really smart student who can understand the main points of an entire essay instantly.

**Real examples**: ChatGPT, Google's search improvements
