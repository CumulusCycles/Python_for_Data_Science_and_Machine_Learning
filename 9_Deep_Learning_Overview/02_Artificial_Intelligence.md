# 2. Artificial Intelligence (AI)

AI is about making machines smart enough to do tasks that normally need human intelligence.

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

**Simple Definition**: AI makes computers act intelligently by learning, reasoning, and solving problems.

**What AI can do:**

- **See**: Recognize faces, read text in images
- **Understand**: Process human language
- **Learn**: Improve performance over time
- **Decide**: Make choices based on data

## Types of AI

### **Narrow AI** (What exists today)

- **Good at one thing**: Each AI system is designed for a specific task
- **Examples**:
  - Google Translate (only translates languages)
  - Chess programs (only play chess)
  - Spam filters (only detect spam emails)

### **General AI** (Future goal)

- **Good at everything**: Would be as smart as humans across all tasks
- **Status**: Doesn't exist yet, might take decades to develop

### **Super AI** (Theoretical)

- **Smarter than humans**: Would exceed human intelligence
- **Status**: Very speculative, far in the future (if ever)

**Key Point**: All AI today is Narrow AI—specialized for specific tasks!
