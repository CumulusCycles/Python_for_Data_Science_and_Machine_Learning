# Python Fundamentals

## Introduction

In this section, we'll explore some fundamental concepts in Python programming, including data types, control structures, functions, and modules.

Please note that the demo videos for these examples will be shown in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). If you don't have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can follow the instructions in the [Installation Guide](https://jupyter.org/install) to set it up, or see my tutorial on how to [Install Jupyter Notebook in a Python Virtual Environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-_GDQRLtbo).

## Topics Covered

- Data Types (Int, Float, String, Boolean)
- Collections (Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries)
- Control Structures (If- statements, Loops)
- Functions (Defining and calling functions)
- Error Handling (Try/Except blocks)
- Modules (Importing and using modules)
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes and objects)
